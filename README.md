# Data-driven hyperparameter optimization

This repository contains code for **Data-driven hyper-optimization** *JetBrains Research*
 project.
 
## About the project
Optimization of hyperparameters for machine learning models is a necessary but expensive operation.
To reduce the resources spent, we want to suggest selecting parameters based on the knowledge of what hyperparameters
worked for similar tasks for other researchers.

We are going to do this based on a dataset of 300K ML Jupiter notebooks that we have.
